          <h3>Hi! I'm Ammad</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a dedicated, and target-oriented individual with overall 2+ years of professional experience as a
            developer for working among the few highly reputed organizations like Telenor Microfinance Bank, Synergy IT,
            and 2vec. I believe I am capable of quickly becoming an asset due to my urge to continually learn and
            acquire new skills, in order to grow and become a better version of myself.

            I stepped into the industry right after my 2nd year of Bachelors of Computer Science. While I'm a proficient
            MERN stack developer and a Flutter mobile application developer, my expertise lies in building responsive
            user interfaces and scalable backend services.

            My expertise is not limited to web and mobile application development as I have worked on several machine
            learning projects and natural language processing projects as well. I'm looking for a contributor role where
            I can be part of a collaborative team, learn new tools and technology, and gain experience as a software
            engineer.
